Attempting to recover code related to this paper:
  http://people.csail.mit.edu/paulfitz/pub/iros03first.pdf

This will be approximate.  The code wasn't version controlled.  I'm picking up
what was lying around after a related thesis and trying to de-QNX it.  The
code uses an ancient version of YARP.  I've remapped the needed parts onto
modern YARP.

A lot of the code checked-in here isn't needed; see CMakeLists.txt for
full list of active source code.

Requirements:
 * Linux
 * YARP (yarp.it)
 * CMake

Compilation:
  mkdir build
  cd build && cmake .. && make
  ./test_segmentation
  # output = ppms
